# leaf-area-and-leaf-area-index
We propose a dataset that can be used for deep learning alfalfa leaf area estimation and leaf area index prediction.Our experiment was conducted in a test field in Yinchuan, Ningxia.The site’s coordinates are approximately 385597 N latitude and 1060677 E longitude, with an elevation of 1120 m. The area experiences distinct four seasons, with an average annual temperature of 8.4°C and an average annual precipitation of 180-200 mm. The majority of the precipitation is concentrated from June to September. The annual sunshine duration is 2800-3000 hours, and the annual evaporation is around 3000 mm. The frost-free period in this area is approximately 185 days, with early frost occurring around September 20th and late frost around May 10th.


The dataset includes alfalfa leaf area data, leaf area index data, meteorological data, effective accumulated temperature, and soil moisture data collected under different water and nitrogen treatments.
Users can download and use data for research purposes for free, simply citing our paper as a data reference.
