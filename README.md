We propose a dataset that can be used for deep learning alfalfa leaf area estimation and leaf area index prediction.
The dataset includes alfalfa leaf area data, leaf area index data, meteorological data, effective accumulated temperature, and soil moisture data collected under different water and nitrogen treatments.
Users can download and use data for research purposes for free, simply citing our paper as a data reference.
